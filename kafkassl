What is SSL?
TLS(Transport Layer Security),successor of SSL,encrypts the connection between two end points for secure data exchange.
Two ways of using SSL and Kafka can use both ways:
1-way verification,e.g.browser=>WebServer (Encryption)
2-way verification,e.g.SSL authentication (Authentication)

Detailed Setup of SSL for Encryption:-
1.Kafka Client
2.Kafka Server
->first thing is to set up SSL certificates
3.Certificate Authority (CA)  - about 20 CA on public web
->Kafka server will have to setup a keystore
4.Keystore - will request CA to sign server-cert for kafka server
->CA signs and sends the certtificate back to keystore so in server we have server-cert signed by CA
5.Trust Store - similar to keystore but not exactly the same
truststore needs to trust CA that means any cert signed by CA will be trusted by truststore
6.SSL Handshake - Kakfa server send signed SSL cert to Kafka client and Kafka Clietn will verify the SSL cert using its truststore
and once it is verified there is a secure SSL encrypted communication between client and server

==================================================================================
1.Generate a certificate(x509) for each Kafka Broker
2.Generate a certificate authority(CA) for signing (public-private key pair & certificate)
3.Sign all broker certificates with generated CA
4.Import CA & signed certificate to broker keystore
5.Import CA to client trust store & broker trust store
